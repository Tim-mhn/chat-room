## To do 

- "User x entered / exited the room" ✓
- OAuth Login / sign up ✓


- OAuth public / private endpoints ✓

- WIP: Send access / idToken with WebSocket requests to identify the user and create more specific messages 
  
-> "User xx entered the room"
-> "User xx sent a message" 
...



- Message date
- Emoji reactions
- Reply to message
- Sent / Read by others 
- Save previously sent messages
- User (sign up / login) vs oAuth ??
